				<p id="p2"> Mister Narendra Damodardas Modi was born on 17 September 1950 in Vadnagar, Gujarat.
				He is role model to many citizens around the globe. He is one poor tea selling kid who rose to become one of India's most powerful and influential prime minister.
				<br><br>
				Modi’s repeated political success in Gujarat, however, made him an indispensable leader within the BJP hierarchy and led to his reintegration into the political mainstream. Projecting a manifesto for growth and development in Gujarat, the BJP was again victorious in the 2007 state assembly elections, with a seat total of 117, and the party prevailed again in the 2012 polls, garnering 115 seats. Both times Modi won his contests and returned as chief minister.
				<br><br>
				His performance is reflected in the many Awards his government received from both National and International media. Shri Narendra Modi as India’s Prime Minister brings with him a rich and hands-on experience as one of India’s most successful Chief Ministers and one of its finest of Administrators.
